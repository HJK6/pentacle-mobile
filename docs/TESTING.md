# Testing

From a fresh checkout, run npm ci, copy pentacle.config.example.ts to
pentacle.config.local.ts, then run npm run test:unit and npm run typecheck.
The shared chat core is vendored, so tests need no private repository or daemon.

For iteration, run npx jest --runInBand --runTestsByPath tests/<file>.test.ts.
Keep fixtures synthetic and preserve protocol fields, error messages, author
prefixes and config keys: those values affect behavior even in synthetic data.
The test host configuration uses hosta, hostb, and hostc.

npm run validate adds an iOS JavaScript export to TypeScript checking.
Jest covers modeled behavior; it does not certify native builds, device signing,
or live spawn/send journeys. Those require the configured daemon and native
runtime described in [Native builds](PENTACLE_MOBILE_BUILD.md).
